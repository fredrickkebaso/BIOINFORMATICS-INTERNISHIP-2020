# BIOINFORMATICS-INTERNISHIP-2020
This s my take on the internship opportunity  
I am Fredrick Kebaso Mariita,  l have a background in Molecular Biology as my major in my undergraduate studies. l am a bioinformatics enthusiast hence my quest to  acquire the skills needed to realize my dream career. I have so far undertaken an introductory course to bioinformatics (IBT), with the H3bionet, this has given me a little experience and insight on what is required of me to become a highly skilled Bioinformatician. I have a little experience with Linux OS and a few ideas in python l look forward to gain more during this internship period.   I strongly, with no doubt believe that this internship training  at ICIPE  is a noble  opportunity for me to learn and network with colleagues of  similar interest  as well as  build a clear roadmap towards achieving my career objective.  
MY VISION FOR THE INTERNISHIP  
1. To   enhance my skills in Linux OS, Python programming and R languages. 
2. To learn, network   and get exposed to the bioinformatics enthusiasts for proper guidance on how to achieve my career. 
3. To get exposed to the real bioinformatics tools and acquit myself with their applications.  
ROAD MAP 
1.	Learn and be conversant with Linux OS. 
2.	Acquire skills in python programming relevant to bioinformatics. 
3.	Learn R scripting language.  
4.	Be able to apply the skills obtained to real biological data analysis and in the bioinformatics field. 
5.	Lastly define a clear path to follow in order to become a highly skilled Bioinformatician.
