# BIOINFORMATICS-INTERNSHIP-2020
I am Fredrick Kebaso Mariita, l have a background in Molecular Biology as my major in my undergraduate studies. I am a bioinformatics enthusiast hence my quest to  acquire the skills needed to realize my dream career. I have so far undertaken an introductory course to bioinformatics (IBT), with the H3bionet, this has given me a little experience and insight on what is required of me to become a highly skilled Bioinformatician. I have a little experience with Linux OS and a few ideas in python l look forward to gain more during this internship period.   Within the three specialization areas in bioinformatics i.e.
- Bioinformatics Engineer
- Bioinformatics User
- Bioinformatics Scientist

My career fits well into the bioinformatics user curriculum according to the ISCB.
I strongly, with no doubt believe that this internship training  at ICIPE  is a noble  opportunity for me to learn and network with colleagues of  similar interest  as well as  build a clear roadmap towards achieving my career objective.

Below is my internship vision as well as my career vision.

**MY INTERNSHIP VISION** 

- To   enhance my skills in Linux OS, Python programming and R languages.
- To learn, network   and get exposed to the bioinformatics enthusiasts for proper guidance on how to achieve my career.
- To get exposed to the real bioinformatics tools and acquit myself with their applications.

**ROAD MAP FOR THE INTERNSHIP**

- Learn and be conversant with Linux OS.
- Acquire skills in python programming relevant to bioinformatics.
- Learn R scripting language. 
- Be able to apply the skills obtained to real biological data analysis and in the bioinformatics field.
- Lastly define a clear path to follow in order to become a highly skilled Bioinformatician. 

**CAREER VISION**

To acquire all the competencies for a bioinformatics user in line with the ISCBâ€™s curriculum   and be able to apply them in research to evoke an impact on how research is conducted as well as disseminate the skills and knowledge to other upcoming Bioinformaticians.
