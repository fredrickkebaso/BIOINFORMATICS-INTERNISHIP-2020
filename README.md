# BIOINFORMATICS-INTERNISHIP-2020
I am Fredrick Kebaso Mariita, l have a background in Molecular Biology as my major in my undergraduate studies. I am a bioinformatics enthusiast hence my quest to  acquire the skills needed to realize my dream career. I have so far undertaken an introductory course to bioinformatics (IBT), with the H3bionet, this has given me a little experience and insight on what is required of me to become a highly skilled Bioinformatician. I have a little experience with Linux OS and a few ideas in python l look forward to gain more during this internship period.   Within the three specialization areas in bioinformatics i.e.
1.	Bioinformatics Engineer
2.	Bioinformatics User
3.	Bioinformatics Scientist.
My career fits well into the bioinformatics user curriculum according to the ISCB.
I strongly, with no doubt believe that this internship training  at ICIPE  is a noble  opportunity for me to learn and network with colleagues of  similar interest  as well as  build a clear roadmap towards achieving my career objective.

Below is my internship vision as well as my career vision.

MY INTERNSHIP VISION 

1. To   enhance my skills in Linux OS, Python programming and R languages.
2. To learn, network   and get exposed to the bioinformatics enthusiasts for proper guidance on how to achieve my career.
3. To get exposed to the real bioinformatics tools and acquit myself with their applications.

ROAD MAP FOR THE INTERNISHIP
1.	Learn and be conversant with Linux OS.
2.	Acquire skills in python programming relevant to bioinformatics.
3.	Learn R scripting language. 
4.	Be able to apply the skills obtained to real biological data analysis and in the bioinformatics field.
5.	Lastly define a clear path to follow in order to become a highly skilled Bioinformatician. 

CAREER VISION
To acquire all the competencies for a bioinformatics user in line with the ISCBâ€™s curriculum   and be able to apply them in research to evoke an impact on how research is conducted as well as disseminate the skills and knowledge to other upcoming Bioinformaticians.
